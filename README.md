# drum2musocv
Arduino sketch to be used in conjunction with USBMidiKlik to adapt the MidiMuso CV-12 to use General Midi note numbers

Based on the example from the FortSevenEffects MIDI library https://github.com/FortySevenEffects/arduino_midi_library

## Future plans

Trigger envelopes via the CV control

Control other modules via MIDI?
